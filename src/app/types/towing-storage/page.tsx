              <h2 className="text-3xl sm:text-4xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6">Understanding Towing & Storage Cover</h2>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                When your trailer is damaged in an accident or suffers a breakdown, the incident doesn't end with the damage itself. You then face additional costs to get your trailer to a repairer, store it safely while repairs are arranged, and potentially cover transportation costs for replacement or alternative arrangements.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Towing and storage cover is an insurance add-on or bundled feature that covers these post-incident costs. Rather than paying out of pocket for expensive towing services or daily storage fees, your insurance covers these costs so you can focus on getting your trailer repaired and back on the road.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                Most comprehensive trailer insurance policies include some level of towing coverage as standard, though storage may be an optional add-on. NZ insurers like AA Insurance, State Insurance, Tower, and others typically offer generous towing limits and often include unlimited roadside assistance.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6 mt-12">What Towing & Storage Coverage Includes</h2>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Professional Towing Services</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                After an accident or breakdown, your trailer typically can't be driven. Professional towing services are required to move it to a repair facility. Towing costs vary based on distance — a 50km tow might cost $300-$500, while a 100km tow could exceed $1,000. In remote areas or with specialized trailers (horse floats, enclosed caravans), costs can be even higher.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Comprehensive towing coverage reimburses all towing costs up to a specified limit, typically $500-$1,000+ per incident. This ensures you can get professional towing without worrying about the bill.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Recovery Services</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Sometimes your trailer doesn't just need towing — it needs recovery. If your trailer goes off the road into a ditch, creek, or boggy ground, standard towing won't work. You need specialized recovery equipment like heavy tow trucks, winches, or cranes to extract the trailer safely.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Recovery costs are substantial. A winch recovery might cost $1,000-$3,000, while crane recovery for a horse float could exceed $5,000. Most comprehensive policies cover recovery costs to encourage you to use professional services rather than attempting dangerous DIY extraction.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Secure Storage Facilities</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                After your trailer is towed, it needs secure storage while repair arrangements are made. Storage facility costs range from $25-$50 per day depending on the facility and location. For a major repair taking 4-6 weeks, storage alone could cost $700-$2,100.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Many comprehensive policies include storage coverage, either for unlimited days or up to 28-30 days per incident. This ensures your trailer is properly secured and protected while you arrange repairs.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Roadside Assistance</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Beyond major accidents, your tow vehicle might have issues while towing your trailer. Roadside assistance covers emergency services like:
              </p>

              <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-6 text-lg text-slate-700">
                <li>Tire changes and repairs</li>
                <li>Fuel delivery if you run out of gas</li>
                <li>Lockout assistance if keys are locked in the vehicle</li>
                <li>Battery jump-start service</li>
                <li>Spare parts delivery</li>
                <li>Emergency repairs to get you back on the road</li>
              </ul>

              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Many insurers provide unlimited roadside assistance calls per year at no additional cost, providing peace of mind when traveling.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Access to Approved Repairers</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Many comprehensive policies include access to a network of approved repairers. These facilities have pre-negotiated rates with your insurer, often reducing your out-of-pocket costs. Using approved repairers also streamlines the claim process because your insurer has relationships with these facilities.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Even if you prefer an independent repairer, comprehensive policies usually cover towing to any facility you choose, not just approved ones.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6 mt-12">Who Benefits Most From Towing & Storage Cover?</h2>

              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Towing and storage cover is particularly valuable for:
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Long-Distance Travelers</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                If you regularly take your caravan on long trips around New Zealand, a breakdown or accident far from home would result in expensive towing bills. Coverage ensures you can get professional help without worrying about costs.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Owners of Expensive Trailers</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Horse floats, quality caravans, and specialized trailers are expensive to repair. Extended storage while waiting for parts is likely. Towing and storage cover protects against these costs.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">People with Limited Access</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                If you don't have a lockup or covered parking at home, secure storage is essential. Towing and storage cover ensures your damaged trailer is properly protected.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Frequent Campers</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Regular caravan users benefit most from comprehensive coverage including towing and storage, because they're more likely to need these services during their active camping years.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6 mt-12">Real-World Example</h2>

                <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4 text-slate-700">

                  <li>Secure storage facility for 6 weeks while parts arrive: $1,800</li>
                  <li>Total out-of-pocket costs without insurance: $2,650</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="text-slate-700 font-bold">
                  With towing and storage cover: Maria pays nothing. The insurance covers all towing and storage costs.

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6 mt-12">Coverage Limits & Considerations</h2>

              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                When reviewing towing and storage coverage:
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Towing Limits</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Most policies cover towing up to a specified distance (often unlimited) or to a limit per incident ($500-$2,000). Check your policy:
              </p>

              <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-6 text-lg text-slate-700">
                <li>Is towing unlimited or capped at a distance?</li>
                <li>Can you tow to any repairer or only approved ones?</li>
                <li>Does it cover recovery (winch extraction)?</li>
                <li>What about towing your tow vehicle if damaged in an accident?</li>
              </ul>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Storage Limits</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Storage coverage varies significantly:
              </p>

              <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-6 text-lg text-slate-700">
                <li>Some policies cover unlimited storage days</li>
                <li>Others limit to 28-30 days per incident</li>
                <li>Some have daily limits ($30-$50 per day)</li>
                <li>Check if storage is only at approved facilities or any secure facility</li>
              </ul>

              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                For major repairs that take 6+ weeks, limited storage might not be sufficient. Ask your insurer about your specific coverage.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6 mt-12">How to Access Towing Services</h2>

              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                When you need towing after an accident or breakdown:
              </p>

              <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4 mb-6 text-lg text-slate-700">
                <li><strong>Call your insurer immediately:</strong> Have your policy number ready. Many insurers provide a 24/7 claims hotline.</li>
                <li><strong>Explain the situation:</strong> Describe what happened and where you are. For accidents, get a police report number.</li>
                <li><strong>Authorize towing:</strong> The insurer will either dispatch a tow truck or authorize you to call an approved provider.</li>
                <li><strong>Provide details:</strong> Tell the tow operator where you want the trailer towed (approved repairer, your home, etc.).</li>
                <li><strong>Get documentation:</strong> Keep receipts and towing documentation for your claim file.</li>
                <li><strong>Follow up:</strong> Confirm coverage with your insurer and ensure towing is processed as a covered claim.</li>
              </ol>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6 mt-12">Cost of Towing & Storage Cover</h2>

              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Towing is often included as standard in comprehensive policies at no additional cost. Storage cover might be an optional add-on costing $20-$50 annually. Given that a single towing incident could cost $500-$1,000+, this coverage provides excellent value.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                When getting quotes, check whether towing is included standard and whether storage is optional. Compare policies carefully, as some insurers offer unlimited coverage while others have limits.
