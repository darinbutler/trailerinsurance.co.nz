              <h2 className="text-3xl sm:text-4xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6">Understanding Third-Party Liability</h2>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Third-party liability insurance is designed to protect you against financial responsibility when your trailer causes damage to someone else's property or injures someone. Unlike comprehensive cover (which protects your own trailer), third-party liability only covers claims from third parties — hence the name.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                In New Zealand, third-party liability is considered essential protection for any vehicle owner, including trailer owners. A serious accident where your trailer damages multiple cars or a building could result in claims exceeding $100,000. Without liability cover, you would be personally responsible for paying these damages, which could be financially catastrophic.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                Most NZ insurers offer third-party liability cover as a standalone policy (the most economical option) or bundled with comprehensive cover. Standard liability limits start at around $20 million in New Zealand, which provides substantial protection for most trailer owners.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6 mt-12">When Third-Party Liability Applies</h2>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Trailer at Fault in an Accident</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                If your trailer is involved in an accident and deemed at fault (or partially at fault), third-party liability cover pays for damage to the other party's vehicle. For example, if your trailer becomes unhitched and collides with oncoming traffic, your liability insurance would cover the damage claims from affected parties.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Trailer Causes Property Damage</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Third-party cover applies when your trailer causes damage to property that isn't a vehicle. If you're reversing and hit a neighbor's fence, or your trailer's contents spill onto the road and damage passing vehicles, third-party liability covers these claims. This extends to damage to public infrastructure like street signs, bollards, power lines, and buildings.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Cargo Spillage or Loss</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                If your trailer carries cargo (whether on a commercial trip or while camping) and the cargo spills onto the road, third-party liability covers claims from other road users who are injured or whose vehicles are damaged. This is particularly important for commercial trailers carrying goods.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Personal Injury Claims</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                If someone is injured as a result of your trailer causing damage, third-party liability covers their personal injury claims. For example, if your trailer causes a car accident and the other driver is hospitalized, their medical expenses would be covered up to your policy limit.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6 mt-12">Why $20M Liability Matters</h2>

              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The $20 million liability limit offered by most NZ insurers provides substantial protection. To understand why this matters, consider these real-world scenarios:
              </p>

              <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 mb-6 text-lg text-slate-700">
                <li><strong>Multi-vehicle accident:</strong> A major pileup involving 5-10 vehicles could result in total damage claims of $500,000-$2 million</li>
                <li><strong>Building damage:</strong> If your trailer damages commercial property, repair costs could be $100,000+</li>
                <li><strong>Personal injury:</strong> Serious injuries resulting in permanent disability could result in claims of $500,000-$5 million</li>
                <li><strong>Multiple fatalities:</strong> Fatal accidents can result in claims that exceed $10 million across multiple families</li>
              </ul>

              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Without adequate liability cover, you could be personally bankrupt if your trailer caused a serious accident. The $20M limit available from NZ insurers provides peace of mind that you're protected against even catastrophic claims.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6 mt-12">What Third-Party Liability Does NOT Cover</h2>

              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                It's important to understand the limitations of third-party liability cover. Third-party policies do NOT cover:
              </p>

              <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 mb-6 text-lg text-slate-700">
                <li>Damage to your own trailer (for this, you need comprehensive cover)</li>
                <li>Your own medical expenses or lost income from accidents</li>
                <li>Damage to your own belongings in or on the trailer</li>
                <li>Claims arising from illegal use of the trailer</li>
                <li>Fines or penalties imposed by authorities</li>
                <li>Claims where the trailer is operated by someone not permitted under the policy</li>
                <li>Intentional damage (e.g., you deliberately cause an accident)</li>
              </ul>

              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                For complete protection, many Kiwis combine third-party liability with comprehensive cover to protect both themselves and other road users.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6 mt-12">Third-Party Liability vs Comprehensive Cover</h2>

              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The key difference is simple: third-party covers damage you cause to others, while comprehensive covers damage to your own trailer. Here's a comparison:

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6 mt-12">How to Handle a Third-Party Claim</h2>

              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                If your trailer causes an accident or damage incident:
              </p>

              <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4 mb-6 text-lg text-slate-700">
                <li><strong>Stop immediately:</strong> Do not leave the scene. Provide your contact and insurance information to affected parties.</li>
                <li><strong>Call police:</strong> For accidents, request a police report number. This creates an official record of the incident.</li>
                <li><strong>Take photos:</strong> Document damage to all vehicles and property involved. Get contact details of witnesses.</li>
                <li><strong>Notify your insurer:</strong> Report the incident to your insurer within 24 hours if possible. Provide all documentation.</li>
                <li><strong>Cooperate fully:</strong> Provide honest information to your insurer. Misrepresenting facts can invalidate your claim.</li>
                <li><strong>Keep records:</strong> Maintain copies of all correspondence with your insurer and third parties.</li>
              </ol>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6 mt-12">Choosing Your Excess</h2>

              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Many insurers offer third-party liability policies with optional excesses. A lower excess means you pay less out-of-pocket if you need to claim, but your premium will be higher. A higher excess means lower premiums but more out-of-pocket costs in a claim. Consider your financial position and risk tolerance when choosing.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6 mt-12">Is Third-Party Liability Enough?</h2>

              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Third-party liability is the minimum recommended cover in New Zealand, and for some trailer owners (particularly those with older, lower-value trailers or infrequent users), it may be sufficient. However, we recommend considering comprehensive cover if:
              </p>

                  <p className="text-slate-700">
                    Regularly inspect your coupling mechanism, safety chains, and electrical connections. Ensure the coupling is compatible with your tow vehicle and rated for the trailer weight.

                  <p className="text-slate-700">
                    Never exceed the trailer's rated capacity. Distribute weight evenly and secure all cargo properly. Overloaded trailers are more prone to failure and accidents.

                    Service your trailer annually, check brakes, tires, lights, and coupling. Neglected maintenance increases accident risk and claims likelihood.

                    Use appropriate securing methods for your cargo. Loose cargo that falls onto the road creates liability for damage to other vehicles.
