              <h2 className="text-3xl sm:text-4xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6">What is Comprehensive Trailer Insurance?</h2>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Comprehensive trailer insurance is the broadest type of cover available, protecting your trailer against a wide range of risks. Unlike basic third-party liability cover, comprehensive policies cover damage to your own trailer from accidents, natural disasters, theft, and more.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                In New Zealand, comprehensive trailer cover is particularly important because standalone trailer policies provide protection that your car insurance typically doesn't. Most car insurance policies only cover your trailer while it's attached to an insured vehicle. Once you unhitch at a campsite or storage facility, you're usually uninsured. Comprehensive trailer insurance covers you whether your trailer is attached to a tow vehicle or sitting independently.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                Major NZ insurers like AA Insurance, AMI, State Insurance, Tower, and Mariner offer comprehensive trailer cover with varying levels of coverage and excess options. When comparing quotes, it's important to understand exactly what's covered, what's excluded, and how the claim settlement process works.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6 mt-12">What's Covered Under Comprehensive Trailer Insurance?</h2>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Accidental Damage</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Comprehensive cover protects against damage resulting from accidents, whether you're at fault or not. This includes collisions with other vehicles, impacts with fixed objects, overturning, and damage from load shifts. If your horse float hits a fence while reversing, your caravan is side-swiped by another vehicle, or your boat trailer collides with a bollard, comprehensive cover has you protected.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Theft and Attempted Theft</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Trailer theft has become a significant problem across New Zealand. Thieves target valuable caravans, horse floats, and boat trailers for parts or resale. Comprehensive cover protects against theft of your entire trailer, as well as attempted theft that results in damage. You'll be covered for the full replacement value (or agreed value if your policy specifies one), minus your chosen excess. Most insurers require you to take reasonable steps to prevent theft, such as using wheel clamps, secure hitches, and parking in safe locations.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Fire and Explosion</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Fire can happen due to electrical faults, cooking accidents in caravans, impact damage igniting fuel or batteries, or external fires in severe weather. Comprehensive cover includes the full cost of replacing your trailer if it's destroyed by fire, plus costs for emergency services and debris removal. This is particularly important for caravans and camper trailers with onboard electrical systems, gas appliances, and lithium or lead-acid batteries.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Weather-Related Damage</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                New Zealand's unpredictable weather means your trailer is at risk from multiple weather events. Comprehensive cover protects against damage from storms, heavy rain, hail, wind, lightning, flooding, and snow. If a tree branch crashes through your caravan during a storm, hail damages the roof, or flooding inundates your stored boat trailer, you're covered. In exceptional weather events, some policies may apply a separate excess or have specific exclusions, so check your policy details.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Natural Disasters</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                New Zealand experiences earthquakes, and some areas are prone to subsidence or landslips. Comprehensive coverage typically includes damage from natural disasters, though earthquake coverage may have specific terms or may be excluded in some policies. If your trailer is damaged during a seismic event or other natural disaster, your comprehensive policy should provide protection.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Towing and Recovery Costs</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                After an accident or breakdown, getting your trailer towed to a repairer can be expensive. Many comprehensive policies include coverage for towing and recovery costs, either fully or up to a certain limit. This can save hundreds of dollars if you're stranded far from home or your regular mechanic.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6 mt-12">What's Usually Excluded?</h2>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                It's important to understand what's not covered by comprehensive trailer insurance. Common exclusions include:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-6 text-lg text-slate-700">
                <li>Wear and tear, rust, corrosion, and gradual deterioration</li>
                <li>Mechanical and electrical breakdowns (not caused by an insured event)</li>
                <li>Damage from faulty maintenance or poor repair quality</li>
                <li>Contents damage (unless you have contents cover as an add-on)</li>
                <li>Damage while towing with an unsuitable or unroadworthy tow vehicle</li>
                <li>Damage to gas bottles or gas system leaks (may require specialist cover)</li>
                <li>Damage from overloading beyond the trailer's rated capacity</li>
                <li>Claims where the trailer was being used for racing or competitive events</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6 mt-12">Choosing Your Excess</h2>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The excess is the amount you agree to pay towards each claim. Choosing a higher excess (e.g., $1,000 instead of $500) will lower your annual premium, but means you'll pay more out-of-pocket if you need to claim. Consider your financial situation and how likely you are to claim when deciding. Some insurers offer optional zero or low excess add-ons for an additional premium.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6 mt-12">Agreed Value vs Market Value</h2>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Some comprehensive policies offer agreed value cover, where you and the insurer agree on the replacement value upfront. This is particularly valuable for well-maintained classic caravans or specialised horse floats where the market value might be difficult to establish after a total loss. Market value cover settles based on the trailer's actual cash value at the time of loss, which can be lower than you expect for older vehicles.

                  <p className="text-slate-700">
                    Don't just accept the first quote. Compare comprehensive policies from at least 3-5 insurers to find the best value. Premiums can vary significantly for the same coverage level.

                  <p className="text-slate-700">
                    Know whether your policy has a fixed excess or different excesses for different types of claims. Some insurers offer low or zero excess options if you're willing to pay slightly higher premiums.

                  <h3 className="font-bold text-slate-900 mb-2">Invest in Security</h3>
                  <p className="text-slate-700">
                    Use approved wheel clamps, secure coupling systems, and park in safe locations. Some insurers offer discounts for additional security measures, which can offset the cost of equipment.

                  <h3 className="font-bold text-slate-900 mb-2">Consider Contents Cover</h3>
                  <p className="text-slate-700">
                    Comprehensive cover protects the trailer structure, but contents (camping gear, appliances, personal items) usually need a separate add-on. Consider your typical cargo value.

                  <h3 className="font-bold text-slate-900 mb-2">Review Annually</h3>
                  <p className="text-slate-700">
                    Insurance needs and premiums change yearly. Review your policy annually to ensure your coverage still matches your needs and you're getting competitive rates.

                  <p className="text-slate-700">
                    Inquire about loyalty discounts, multi-policy discounts, good driver discounts, and membership discounts (AA, motoring clubs). These can reduce your premium by 10-20%.
