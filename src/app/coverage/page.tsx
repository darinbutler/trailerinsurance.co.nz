              <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Comprehensive coverage represents the highest level of protection available for your trailer. This policy covers accidental damage, theft, fire, storm damage, and more. It's the most popular choice for valuable trailers, caravans, and those used regularly on NZ roads. Comprehensive cover also typically includes third-party liability protection, so you're covered if your trailer causes damage or injury to others.
              </p>
              <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                With <Link href="/types/comprehensive" className="text-amber-600 hover:text-amber-700 font-semibold underline">comprehensive coverage</Link>, you gain peace of mind knowing that most common scenarios are covered. Whether your trailer is damaged in a collision, affected by severe weather, or stolen, your insurance will help cover repair or replacement costs.
              </p>
              <p className="text-slate-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Many comprehensive policies for <Link href="/insurance/caravan-insurance-nz" className="text-amber-600 hover:text-amber-700 font-semibold underline">caravans</Link> and <Link href="/insurance/boat-trailer-insurance-nz" className="text-amber-600 hover:text-amber-700 font-semibold underline">boat trailers</Link> include additional benefits like roadside assistance, emergency accommodation if your caravan becomes uninhabitable, and optional contents cover for your belongings inside.
              </p>
            </div>

            {/* Third-Party Liability */}
            <div className="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-8">
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">Third-Party Liability Cover</h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                <Link href="/types/third-party-liability" className="text-amber-600 hover:text-amber-700 font-semibold underline">Third-party liability cover</Link> is the legal minimum requirement in New Zealand and provides essential protection if your trailer damages someone else's property or causes injury to another person. This coverage protects you financially if you're held liable for claims arising from your trailer.
              </p>
              <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Your liability limit is typically up to $20 million, which covers legal costs, medical expenses, and property damage claims made against you. While basic third-party only policies are the most affordable option, they don't cover damage to your own trailer—only your legal liability to others.
              </p>
              <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                This is an excellent option if your trailer has minimal value or you're looking for the most budget-friendly coverage. However, many Kiwis combine third-party liability with theft and fire protection for better value, creating a middle-ground coverage level.
              </p>
            </div>

            {/* Agreed Value */}
            <div className="border-l-4 border-green-500 pl-8">
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">Agreed Value Cover</h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                <Link href="/types/agreed-value" className="text-amber-600 hover:text-amber-700 font-semibold underline">Agreed value coverage</Link> eliminates depreciation concerns by locking in your trailer's value upfront. When you agree on a value with your insurer at the time of purchase, you'll receive that exact amount if your trailer is written off or stolen—regardless of how much it's worth at claim time.
              </p>
              <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                This is particularly valuable for newer trailers and high-end caravans or boat trailers, where depreciation happens quickly. By choosing agreed value, you know precisely what you'll receive in a total loss situation, making it easier to plan your replacement.
              </p>
              <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                The alternative is market value coverage, where your payout is calculated based on your trailer's market value at the time of the claim—which may be less than you hoped. Agreed value provides certainty and peace of mind, especially important when you own specialty trailers or custom setups.
              </p>
            </div>

            {/* Contents Cover */}
            <div className="border-l-4 border-purple-500 pl-8">
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">Contents Cover</h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                <Link href="/types/contents-cover" className="text-amber-600 hover:text-amber-700 font-semibold underline">Contents cover</Link> is an optional add-on that protects the belongings stored inside your caravan or trailer. This includes camping gear, kitchen appliances, bedding, personal items, and other possessions. Without this add-on, your standard trailer insurance only covers the trailer structure itself—not what's inside.
              </p>
              <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                For caravan owners who travel extensively, contents cover is highly recommended. Whether your caravan is your holiday getaway or your home on wheels, protecting the valuable equipment and personal items inside is essential. This coverage typically covers theft, accidental damage, and weather-related damage to your contents.
              </p>
              <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                When selecting a contents limit, think about your cooking equipment, beds, entertainment systems, tools, and personal belongings. Contents cover offers protection tailored specifically to caravan owners and is often very affordable when added to a comprehensive policy.
              </p>
            </div>

            {/* Towing & Storage */}
            <div className="border-l-4 border-orange-500 pl-8">
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">Towing & Storage Cover</h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                <Link href="/types/towing-storage" className="text-amber-600 hover:text-amber-700 font-semibold underline">Towing and storage cover</Link> protects you against the unexpected costs that arise after an accident or breakdown. If your trailer breaks down or is damaged, emergency towing can cost hundreds of dollars. This coverage reimburses those costs and also covers storage fees while your trailer is being repaired.
              </p>
              <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                This add-on is particularly valuable for caravan owners who travel far from home. Breaking down on a remote NZ road could result in expensive towing fees, especially if towing must happen over long distances. Storage cover ensures you're not left paying out of pocket while repairs are being completed.
              </p>
              <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                Many insurers include towing and storage as part of standard or comprehensive policies, but it's worth checking your policy details. For those frequently taking their trailers on long journeys, this coverage provides valuable protection and peace of mind.
              </p>
            </div>

                <Link href="/types/commercial" className="text-amber-600 hover:text-amber-700 font-semibold underline">Commercial trailer insurance</Link> is designed for business owners who use trailers for work purposes. This specialised coverage includes protection for goods in transit, public liability for your business operations, and trade-related risks that standard consumer policies don't cover.
              </p>
              <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                If you operate a trade business, transport goods for clients, or use your trailer as part of a commercial venture, standard consumer insurance won't provide adequate protection. Commercial policies are tailored to business needs and often include higher liability limits and specific coverage for business equipment and cargo.
              </p>
              <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                From tradies transporting tools and materials to businesses using trailers for deliveries, commercial coverage ensures your business operations are properly protected. Coverage extends to include liability for damage caused to clients' property or third parties during the course of business.

              <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4">
                New Zealand experiences diverse weather patterns, from heavy rain in the south to extreme wind events in the north. Comprehensive coverage that includes storm and flood damage is essential for NZ trailer owners. Winter snow and ice in alpine regions create additional risks, while the coastal environment increases salt corrosion risks.
              </p>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                If you frequently travel in areas prone to flooding or severe weather, ensure your policy specifically covers flood damage. Some policies have geographic limitations or exclusions for certain weather events.

              <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4">
                NZ has specific towing regulations regarding trailer weight, braking systems, and safety standards. Your insurance must comply with your trailer's registration and usage. Make sure your insurer knows the accurate weight and specifications of your trailer, as misrepresentation could affect claims.
              </p>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                Understand your towing vehicle's capacity and ensure you're not exceeding weight limits. Some insurers have specific requirements for trailers towed by certain vehicle types.

              <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4">
                Rural areas present different risks (stock gates, farm equipment collisions, remote breakdowns) compared to urban areas (theft, parking damage). Your coverage should reflect where your trailer spends most of its time. Rural users benefit from towing cover, while urban users may prioritize theft protection.
              </p>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                Consider how often you travel between rural and urban areas and ensure your coverage is appropriate for your actual usage patterns.

              <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4">
                Many Kiwis use caravans and trailers primarily during holidays. If your usage is seasonal, discuss this with your insurer. Some policies offer seasonal discounts or adjusted coverage for trailers used only at certain times of year.
              </p>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                Summer holidays and school breaks increase towing on NZ roads. Ensure your policy covers the specific dates and periods when you plan to travel.

              <p className="text-slate-700">

              <p className="text-slate-700">
                Choosing a value that's too low to save on premiums will result in lower payouts when claiming. If your trailer is worth $30,000, insuring it for $20,000 leaves you significantly exposed. Use <Link href="/types/agreed-value" className="text-amber-600 hover:text-amber-700 font-semibold underline">agreed value coverage</Link> to lock in the correct amount.

              <p className="text-slate-700">
                Many caravan owners forget that contents inside aren't covered by the trailer policy alone. Your camping equipment, kitchen appliances, bedding, and personal items need separate <Link href="/types/contents-cover" className="text-amber-600 hover:text-amber-700 font-semibold underline">contents cover</Link> protection. Without it, theft or damage could be completely uninsured.

              <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-slate-900 mb-3">Choosing Only Third-Party Liability</h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                While meeting legal minimums, third-party only leaves your own trailer completely unprotected. A collision or theft could be catastrophic financially. Adding theft and fire protection creates a much safer middle ground between cost and coverage.
              </p>

              <p className="text-slate-700">
                Using a personal policy for business purposes can invalidate coverage. If you use your trailer for work or commercial purposes, you need <Link href="/types/commercial" className="text-amber-600 hover:text-amber-700 font-semibold underline">commercial coverage</Link> to ensure claims are protected. Being dishonest about usage is grounds for claim denial.

              <p className="text-slate-700">
                A low premium might come with a high excess ($1,000 or more). Ensure you can afford the excess if you need to claim. Balance the premium savings against the excess amount you'd pay out of pocket.
              </p>

                If you modify your trailer, add expensive equipment, or change how you use it, your coverage may no longer be appropriate. Review and update your policy annually or whenever your trailer circumstances change.
