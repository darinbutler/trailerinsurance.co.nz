              <h2 className="text-3xl sm:text-4xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6">Why Caravan Insurance is Essential in New Zealand</h2>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Caravans are a significant investment, and many New Zealand families rely on them for holidays, weekend getaways, and extended travel adventures. Whether you own a single-axle van, a large family caravan, or a luxury pop-top, specialist caravan insurance is crucial to protect your asset.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Standard car insurance policies don't provide adequate cover for caravans once they're unhitched from your tow vehicle. Your caravan can be exposed to theft, weather damage, accidental damage, and vandalism while parked at holiday parks, in storage, or at home. Dedicated caravan insurance fills this gap with comprehensive protection designed specifically for your caravanning lifestyle.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                New Zealand's top insurers—AA Insurance, AMI, State Insurance, Tower, and Mariner—all offer specialised caravan policies with flexibility to match your needs. The right policy protects not just the caravan structure but also the electrical systems, appliances, and contents that make your travels comfortable.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6 mt-12">What Caravan Insurance Covers in NZ</h2>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">The Caravan Structure and Chassis</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Comprehensive caravan insurance covers damage to the caravan body, chassis, frame, walls, roof, windows, and doors. If your caravan is damaged in an accident, hit by falling debris, or damaged by weather events, your insurance covers the structural repairs or replacement. This includes damage to permanent fixtures like built-in furniture, kitchen units, and bathroom installations.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Electrical Systems and Appliances</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Modern caravans contain complex electrical systems, water heating, air conditioning, refrigeration, and cooking appliances. Quality caravan insurance covers damage to these systems when caused by an insured event such as an accident, lightning strike, or electrical fault resulting from impact damage. Some policies include optional mechanical breakdown cover if your fridge or other appliances fail during your holidays.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Theft Protection</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Caravan theft is an increasing problem across New Zealand. Thieves target caravans for their valuable contents, appliances, or to resell the entire unit. Comprehensive caravan insurance protects against the theft of your entire caravan or attempted theft that causes damage. To qualify for theft cover, you'll need to demonstrate reasonable security measures such as wheel clamps, coupling locks, and parking in secure locations when possible.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Weather and Natural Disaster Coverage</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                New Zealand's weather can be unpredictable. Caravan insurance covers damage from storms, heavy rain, hail, wind, lightning, and flooding. If a branch crashes through your caravan during a storm, hail damages your awning, or a flood affects your vehicle while parked at a holiday park, you're covered. Natural disaster coverage includes earthquakes and subsidence, though some policies may have specific terms for these events.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Contents Insurance Add-on</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Your caravan insurance typically covers the structure, but your personal contents—camping equipment, bedding, cooking gear, and valuables—usually need a separate contents policy add-on. This covers your items if they're damaged or stolen. Given the value of camping equipment and the fact that your caravan often travels to remote locations, contents cover is highly recommended.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Accidental Damage</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Accidents happen, especially during towing. If you collide with another vehicle, hit a low bridge, or swerve to avoid an obstacle and damage your caravan, accidental damage cover protects you. This includes damage from overturning, load shifts, and impacts with fixed objects like fence posts, trees, or bollards while parked or being towed.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Towing and Recovery</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                If your caravan becomes damaged or unsafe to tow, you'll need professional assistance. Most comprehensive caravan policies include cover for towing and recovery costs to get your caravan to a repairer. This can cost hundreds of dollars if you break down far from home, so this coverage is invaluable.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6 mt-12">Key Considerations for Caravan Insurance</h2>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Agreed Value vs Market Value</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Many insurers offer agreed value caravan insurance, where you declare the value of your caravan upfront. If it's a total loss, you'll be paid this agreed amount without depreciation disputes. This is especially valuable for well-maintained caravans or unusual models where market value would be difficult to establish. Market value policies settle based on what your caravan would fetch at the time of loss, which can be lower than you expect.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Annual vs Multi-Year Policies</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Most insurers offer annual caravan policies, though some allow multi-year arrangements if you're a good customer. Annual policies give you flexibility to review your coverage and shop around each year. Multi-year policies can offer savings but lock you in—make sure you're happy with the terms before committing.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Usage Restrictions</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Some caravan insurance policies have usage restrictions. For example, policies might have mileage limits, restrict towing to certain vehicle types, or require that your caravan isn't left unattended in remote areas for extended periods. Always read the fine print to ensure your intended use is covered.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Safety and Security Requirements</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                To qualify for comprehensive caravan insurance, you'll typically need to take basic security precautions. This includes using approved wheel clamps, securing the coupling, parking in safe locations when possible, and having the caravan inspected regularly. Some insurers offer discounts for additional security measures like GPS trackers or alarm systems.
              </p>
