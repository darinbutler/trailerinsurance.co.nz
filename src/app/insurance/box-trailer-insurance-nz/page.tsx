              <h2 className="text-3xl sm:text-4xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6">Why Box Trailers Need Insurance</h2>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Box trailers are essential for tradies, business owners, and DIY enthusiasts across New Zealand. Whether you use your box trailer for work equipment, moving tools between job sites, or hauling materials for home projects, it represents a valuable asset that deserves protection.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Box trailers are frequently left unattended at work sites, business premises, or parking areas. They're vulnerable to theft, break-ins, and vandalism. Your standard car insurance doesn't cover your trailer when it's unhitched and parked, leaving you exposed. Specialist box trailer insurance fills this gap with comprehensive coverage designed for working trailers.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                Insurance providers AA Insurance, AMI, State, Tower, and others all offer box trailer policies with flexibility for different usage patterns and coverage needs. Whether you need basic coverage or comprehensive protection with contents insurance, there's an option for your situation.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6 mt-12">What Box Trailer Insurance Covers</h2>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Trailer Structure and Body</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Insurance covers damage to the box trailer chassis, frame, walls, roof, floor, and doors. If your box trailer is hit by another vehicle, you back into a bollard, or accident damage occurs while towing, your insurance covers structural repairs or replacement.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Locking Systems and Security</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Modern box trailers feature quality locks, hinges, and security systems. Insurance covers damage to these when caused by attempted break-ins or accident damage. Strengthening security with locks, reinforced doors, or alarm systems may qualify you for discounts.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Brakes and Suspension</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Box trailers have brake systems and suspension components that take stress from loaded towing. Insurance covers damage to brakes, suspension springs, axles, and bearings when damaged by accidents or impacts. A functioning brake system is essential for safe towing.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Electrical and Lighting</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Quality box trailer insurance covers damage to lights, wiring, and electrical connections essential for road safety. If impact damage breaks your lights or corrodes electrical components, insurance covers repairs or replacement.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Theft Protection</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Box trailers left at work sites or storage yards are targets for thieves. Comprehensive insurance covers theft of the entire unit or break-ins where thieves steal tools or equipment inside. Use wheel clamps and coupling locks to qualify for theft cover.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Vandalism and Break-in Damage</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Vandalism damage—broken locks, damaged doors, forced windows—is covered by comprehensive policies. If someone attempts to break in and damages your box trailer, you're protected.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Contents Insurance Add-on</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Your box trailer insurance typically covers the structure, but tools, equipment, and materials inside often need separate contents coverage. Optional contents insurance protects valuable equipment, power tools, materials, and other items you store inside.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6 mt-12">Box Trailer Insurance Considerations</h2>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Commercial vs Personal Use</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Declare your intended use. If you use your box trailer for business or trade purposes, you need commercial-rated coverage. Personal use trailers have different premiums. Using commercial equipment with personal insurance may void claims.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Storage Location</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Where you park your box trailer affects your insurance premium and coverage. Secure storage (locked compound, garage) commands lower premiums than street parking or exposed work sites. Be honest about where your trailer is typically parked.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Security Requirements</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                To qualify for comprehensive cover, you'll typically need to use approved wheel clamps and coupling locks. Some insurers offer discounts for alarm systems or tracking devices.
              </p>

                <li>Consider an alarm system or GPS tracker for additional protection and discounts</li>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6 mt-12">Common Box Trailer Claims and Scenarios</h2>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Impact Damage and Road Accidents</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Collision damage is among the most frequent box trailer claims. Backing into bollards, hitting low structures when reversing, or side-impact collisions while towing all cause significant damage. Accidental damage coverage protects against these incidents, though you pay an agreed excess. Always report accidents promptly to your insurer and provide photos of damage, vehicle positions, and any witness contact details.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Theft and Break-Ins</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Work site theft is a serious issue for box trailer owners. Thieves break into trailers to steal tools, equipment, and materials. Comprehensive insurance covers theft and break-in damage. To qualify for theft cover, you must use approved security—wheel clamps, coupling locks, and ideally alarm systems. Report thefts immediately to police and provide the crime reference number to your insurer.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Brake and Electrical Failures</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Brake failures can occur suddenly on working trailers. If brakes fail due to accident damage or impact (not normal wear), insurance covers repairs. Similarly, electrical failures from accidents or impacts are covered. However, standard insurance excludes mechanical breakdowns from normal wear. Optional mechanical breakdown coverage can protect against system failures if you want comprehensive protection.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Vandalism and Damage at Work Sites</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Trailers left at work sites attract vandals who damage locks, break doors, or slash covers. Comprehensive policies cover vandalism damage. Prevention is key—park in well-lit, monitored areas when possible. Use wheel clamps and couple locks to deter opportunistic thieves. Document any vandalism with photos before cleanup, and report to police if significant damage occurs.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6 mt-12">Box Trailer Insurance Premium Factors</h2>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Usage Type: Personal vs Commercial</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Your declared usage significantly affects premiums. Personal-use trailers (for DIY projects or occasional moving) are cheaper than commercial-use trailers (for trade or regular business). If you use your trailer for business activities but insure it as personal use, claims may be denied. Always declare your actual usage accurately. Commercial coverage isn't always prohibitively expensive—it's worth getting proper quotes for your intended use.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Storage Location and Security</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Where you park your trailer dramatically affects premiums. Trailers in secure storage (locked compound, garage, controlled parking) cost significantly less to insure than those parked on street or at exposed work sites. Upgrading your storage security—adding locked compound access or moving to managed parking—can reduce premiums. Some insurers offer 15-25% discounts for secure storage.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Security Features and Devices</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Security devices qualify for insurance discounts. Approved wheel clamps save 5-10%, quality coupling locks add protection, and alarm systems or GPS trackers can save 10-15%. The cost of good security devices often pays for itself through reduced premiums within 1-2 years. Beyond insurance savings, these devices genuinely protect your investment.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Box Trailer Value and Contents</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Your trailer's replacement value determines base premiums. Higher-value trailers cost more to insure. If you add valuable equipment or tools inside, contents insurance premiums increase accordingly. However, leaving expensive tools inside an uninsured trailer is risky—an affordable contents policy often costs less than replacing stolen equipment.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6 mt-12">Choosing the Right Coverage for Your Trailer</h2>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Third-Party Liability vs Comprehensive Protection</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                <Link href="/types/third-party-liability" className="text-amber-600 hover:text-amber-700 font-semibold underline">Third-party liability insurance</Link> is the legal minimum for trailers in New Zealand, covering damage you cause to others' property or vehicles. However, it doesn't protect your box trailer. Most owners choose <Link href="/types/comprehensive" className="text-amber-600 hover:text-amber-700 font-semibold underline">comprehensive coverage</Link>, which protects your trailer against accident damage, theft, vandalism, and other perils.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Adding Contents Insurance</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                <Link href="/types/contents-cover" className="text-amber-600 hover:text-amber-700 font-semibold underline">Contents insurance</Link> protects tools, equipment, and materials you store inside. This is essential for work trailers carrying valuable equipment. Contents policies cover theft, impact damage, and weather damage to items inside. Many insurers allow you to add contents cover as an optional extra to your basic box trailer policy.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Excess Amounts and Affordability</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Choose an excess (deductible) you can afford. Smaller excesses ($250-$500) mean lower out-of-pocket costs when you claim but higher premiums. Larger excesses ($1000+) reduce premiums but increase your personal financial risk. Many owners balance this by selecting $500-$750 excesses that match their financial capacity while controlling premiums.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6 mt-12">Box Trailer Insurance for Different Uses</h2>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">DIY and Home Project Use</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Homeowners using box trailers for occasional DIY projects can often use personal use policies. These tend to be more affordable than commercial rates. Declare your usage honestly—if you're moving between multiple projects monthly, that's approaching commercial use. Getting a competitive personal-use quote is straightforward; if your usage is borderline, ask insurers directly whether you qualify for personal rates.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Trade and Small Business Use</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Tradies and small business owners need <Link href="/types/commercial" className="text-amber-600 hover:text-amber-700 font-semibold underline">commercial trailer coverage</Link> appropriate for their regular work. Commercial policies accommodate frequent work site use, regular equipment transport, and business operations. While premiums are higher than personal use, commercial rates are competitive. Many insurers specialize in trade customers and offer good rates and claims support for work trailers.

              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                If you use your trailer seasonally or infrequently, ask about reduced premiums during storage months. Some insurers offer winter or off-season discounts. Conversely, declaring sporadic use (a few trips per year) may qualify you for lower personal-use rates than frequent commercial use. Be honest about frequency so your policy matches your actual usage pattern.

              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Review your policy annually. Claims history, age of your trailer, and security improvements all affect pricing. Switching insurers if you find better rates is common. Many insurers offer discounts for new customers or multi-policy bundling. Don't just renew automatically—actively shop your insurance each year to ensure you're paying competitive rates.
