              <h2 className="text-3xl sm:text-4xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6">Why Horse Float Insurance is Critical</h2>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Horse floats represent a significant financial investment, often costing $15,000 to $50,000 or more depending on size, features, and build quality. Beyond the monetary value, your horse float is essential to your equestrian activities—whether you're competing at shows, traveling to events, or transporting horses for agistment or veterinary care.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Unlike a caravan that sits stationary, horse floats are regularly in transit, exposing them to accident risks. They're parked at stables, events, and rural properties where theft and vandalism are concerns. They have specialized features—partitions, ventilation, ramps, internal fittings—that require equine-specific knowledge to replace properly after damage.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                Insurance specialists and mainstream providers like AA Insurance, AMI, State, Tower, and Mariner offer horse float policies. However, specialist equine insurers or providers with strong equine focus understand the unique needs of horse owners better than generalist insurance companies.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6 mt-12">Comprehensive Horse Float Coverage Explained</h2>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Float Structure and Partitions</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Quality insurance covers the entire float structure: chassis, body panels, roof, floor, ramps, and internal partitions. Horse floats are custom-built with specific partition systems, ventilation arrangements, and safety features. If your float is damaged in an accident, you need insurance that covers not just basic repairs but restoration of these specialized equine components.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Ventilation and Air Quality Systems</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Modern horse floats feature specialized ventilation systems crucial for horse health during transport. These systems prevent heat stress and provide adequate air circulation. Insurance covers damage to ventilation ducting, grilles, and fans. A damaged ventilation system can make the float unsafe or uncomfortable for horses to travel in.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Ramps and Loading Equipment</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Ramps are critical safety features for loading and unloading horses. Heavy-duty ramps, electric motors, and hydraulic systems are expensive to repair or replace. Insurance covers damage to ramps, motors, and related loading equipment that occur from accidents or impacts.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Electrical and Lighting Systems</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Horse floats have complex electrical systems for lights, charging batteries, and operating electric ramps or ventilation. Accidents can damage wiring harnesses, connections, and light clusters. Quality insurance covers these electrical components when damaged by insured events.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Accidental Damage and Collision</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Accidents happen while towing. If another vehicle hits your float, you clip a gatepost while reversing, or your float swerves and impacts an obstacle, accidental damage cover protects you. This includes damage from overturning during emergency maneuvers.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Theft and Vandalism</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Horse floats are targeted for theft, particularly at equestrian events where multiple floats are parked together. Thieves steal expensive ramps, electrical components, and entire floats for resale. Insurance covers theft of the entire float or parts, plus damage from vandalism.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Towing and Recovery</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                If your horse float becomes unsafe to tow, you'll need professional recovery. Getting a damaged float towed from a remote location can cost hundreds or thousands of dollars. Most comprehensive policies include towing and recovery costs.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6 mt-12">Specific Considerations for Horse Float Insurance</h2>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Declaring Equine Use</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Make sure your insurance policy is specifically written for horse transport. Using a standard utility trailer policy to transport horses may void coverage. Your floats must be declared as horse transport equipment to your insurer.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Show and Event Travel</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                If you travel extensively to shows and competitions, ensure your policy covers your travel patterns. Some policies limit usage or require disclosure of frequent traveling. Always declare where you typically travel.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Towing Vehicle Suitability</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Your insurance requires that your horse float be towed by a suitable, roadworthy vehicle. Using an undersized or unsuitable vehicle may void coverage. Ensure your tow vehicle is properly maintained and capable of safely towing your float.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">Regular Maintenance</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Keep your float well-maintained. Insurers may deny claims if they determine that poor maintenance contributed to damage. This includes regular brake maintenance, electrical checks, and structural inspections.
              </p>
